What impacts Computer Studies enrolment in Ontario?

There's the *chicken and egg problem*, for one. Our courses are not prerequisites for [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics)-related majors in Ontario universities... because not all secondary schools in Ontario offer Computer Studies courses. It's hard to require a course that is not offered. That's [only going to get worse](https://www.thestar.com/politics/provincial/2019/07/08/ontarios-new-class-size-means-toronto-york-school-boards-forced-to-cut-stem-classes.html).

There's a perception that our courses are *difficult*. Any student who has spent inordinate amounts of time struggling with syntax will agree that can be true (even if it's often  [the tools that are deficient](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming) and not the programmer).

And then... there's this, from the lede on a [recent episode of 99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/invisible-women/) by [Roman Mars](http://romanmars.com):

> Today’s show is about a design flaw that might be, and I’m not exaggerating here, the single-most common design flaw in human history. It potentially affects everything we have ever built. Its consequences are felt by more than half of people worldwide...

*What's this now?*

There's a town in Sweden. Karlskoga. It snows there. For a long time, like many places, when it snowed, major roads were cleared first. In the process of doing a gender analysis of local town policies, someone made a joke – *snow clearing*. It couldn't possibly have anything to do with gender, could it?



Karlskoga city planners looked at the types of tasks  women handle on a daily basis. Tasks like shuttling children to school, stopping off to pick up groceries, dropping in to check on elderly relatives. Tasks that were often completed on foot or by taking public transit on smaller residential roads.

It turns out... it's a lot harder, and much less safe, to push a stroller through a foot of snow than it is to drive a car down a major arterial road. Karlskoga decided to clear minor roads and residential areas first, and saw a significant decrease in healthcare costs, savings that far outweighed the cost of winter road maintenance.

What if, by making deliberate choices about how we describe and deploy our Computer Studies courses, we bring in not just more young women, but more students overall to this vital field of endeavour?

### Context Over Tools

I recently visited Austin, Texas to attend a weeklong workshop with teachers using [Swift](https://swift.org/about/) for instruction in the College Board's Advanced Placement [Computer Science Principles](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles) course.

The workshop was hosted by Apple, and we naturally spent time examining [their curricular resources](https://www.apple.com/everyone-can-code/) and [tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). 

I was pleased to see that the agenda focused not just on tools, but the bigger picture of inclusion in the software industry and in our classrooms. [Douglas Kiang](http://www.kiang.net/interests.html) gave an excellent talk on fostering a sense of belonging for young women in computer science courses.

With permission from Douglas, I will include text from some of his presentation here.

The following is an older description for a course offered at [Douglas' school](https://www.punahou.edu):

> **Introduction to JavaScript (1 credit)**
>
> This course introduces students to the basics of JavaScript, HTML,   and CSS. It covers basic computer programming concepts such as variables, loops, operators, arrays, functions, and conditional statements. It features best practices for current web-standards compliance techniques using the HTML DOM (Document Object Model) and offers interested students the opportunity to dive deeper into asynchronous data requests using AJAX and jQuery.

The question Douglas posed: *Who is your audience?*

To whom does that original course description speak?

As teachers, we understand it. Would a student?

It's kind of like seeing a course description like this:

> **Introduction to Japanese (1 credit)**
>
> 基本クラスは、基本的な⽂文法に注意を払いながら、コミュニケーションスキル (主に会話型)を身に付けることを⽬目的としています。 中級クラスは、基本レベ ルの⽂文型を組み合わせることにより、実⽤用的な会話能⼒力力をさらに⾼高めることを⽬目 的としています。 各グループは週に1回、⽇日本⼈人ボランティアによる約90分の レッスンを受けます。 参加者のスケジュールが特定の⽇日の出席を許可しない場 合、会議は⾒見見逃される可能性があります。 授業内容は、グループの規模と参加者 の興味と能⼒力力に応じて調整されます。 基本的な焦点は、⽇日常⽣生活や勉勉強に必要な ⽇日本語の会話⼒力力を伸ばし、⽇日本の⽂文化や伝統について指導することです。

Douglas and his colleagues revised the course description to read as follows:

> **Building Websites for Non-Profits**
> **(1 credit + community service)**
>
> Work closely with a community organization to help design a website that meets their needs. Gain programming experience while designing a front-end web interface that retrieves data from a server. Previous projects have included an event registration page for Malama Honua, an after-school program site for the Boys and Girls Club, and a web portal for the Arcadia Retirement Residence.

Same course, same content, different advertising.

The result? Punahou School school saw many more young women enrol, as well as more young men.

Students in Ontario will always see the standard Ministry of Education course descriptions in official documentation.

It's the very definition of *picking the low hanging fruit* for us, as teachers, to provide the Guidance staff, students, and parents at our schools with accessible and welcoming course descriptions, and ensure that these are made visible to students well in advance of course selection time.

### Build Community

For the first time in my teaching career[^1], the gender balance in my Computer Studies classes across Grades 10 and 11 is precisely even. At last check, there are seven boys and ten girls enrolled in ICS2O; eleven boys and eight girls in ICS3U.

[^1]: Talking about historical gender balance in my Computer Studies classes is complicated by the fact that while I have been a teacher at co-ed schools, I have also taught at an all-girls and an all-boys school. In Canada, we call that a hat trick.

With few other variables in the mix, I'm left to cautiously conclude that some opportunities we offered last year at [Lakefield College School](https://www.lcs.on.ca) have made a difference for enrolment this year.

First, in December 2018, my school partnered with the Hackergal team to participate in [a hackathon](https://twitter.com/hashtag/hackergal2018). In [their words](https://www.hackergal.org/how-it-works/):

> A Hackathon is an event in which groups of people **come together to solve a problem**. The term is largely used in the tech industry to describe a fast-paced event in which computer programmers or “coders” work together to create a functioning product. During a Hackergal Hackathon, **groups of girls work together** over a day to **apply coding skills** they’ve learned leading up to Hackathon Day. Teams **will work together to create an interactive project** with a theme that is revealed on the morning of the Hackathon. 

To prepare for the hackathon, we had twelve grade 9 girls complete five lessons over roughly ten hours of co-curricular time.

The Hackergal organization provided all of the preparatory material and tools free of charge, and were extremely strong communicators leading up to the event itself.

On the day of the hackathon, the girls were excused from class and completed the challenge along with a much larger group of young women across the country through an online presence.

{{< tweet 1072906531727917056 >}}

As a strategy, advocating for and offering an event like this takes more time than re-writing course descriptions – but it created an amazing sense of community among the young women at our school before they even got to the point of considering enrolment in a computer science course.

### Provide a Trial Run

Developers often allow users to try out their software prior to asking for the commitment of a payment.

In the same vein, at LCS, we offered a coding-themed day to coincide with [Computer Science Education Week](https://csedweek.org).

On an *intercession day* at LCS – when the entire school had a break from regular classes, but the learning continues through other tasks – students had (among other options) the opportunity to participate in a day of coding-related activities.

These included generating physical artwork by [generating SVG files through code](https://www.turtlestitch.org/run) and then sending the files [to a plotter](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/846):

* generating physical artwork through code using a plotter
* exploring graphics

### Positive Role Models

Timed to coincide with 

* CS Education Week - video chats with graduates

### Highlight the Diversity of the Field

* Hackergals panel 
	* panelists describing interest in technology blossoming once they realized everything it involved (design, UI/UX, software quality, client management, team management... it's way more than coding)

* Maybe show an Apple video re: solving problems not just coding


* Low-stakes simulation of entire software development process
	* LDPS / LCS collaboration
	* this is being true to the curriculum
* Share photos from LCS/LDPS collaboration
* Share structure / rubrics for LDPS / LCS collaboration
	* On rubrics link to John Rampelt's single-point rubric presentation
	* Alice 3 resources (revised lessons)
	* Thunkable materials
* Share comments from students at the end of the year
	* intend to do pre-post surveys next year
* This *is* the curriculum...
	
> Computer studies is about how computers compute. It is not about learning how to use the computer, and <mark>it is much more than computer programming</mark>. Computer studies is the study of ways of representing objects and processes. <mark>It involves defining problems; analysing problems; designing solutions; and developing, testing, and maintaining programs</mark>. For the purposes of this document, the term computer studies refers to the study of computer science, meaning computer and algorithmic processes, including their principles, their hardware and software designs, their applications, and <mark>their impact on society</mark>. The major focus of these courses is the development of programming skills, which are important for success in future postsecondary studies.[^2]

[^2]: *The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 10 to 12, Computer Studies (Revised)* (Toronto:  Ministry of Education, 2008), 3. 

* A bit reductionist but...
	* ICS3U > Software lifecycle on an individual level
	* ICS4U > Software lifecycle in teams (very explicit, entire strand)
* Let's make ICS2O an introduction to the more demanding in-depth experiences of ICS4U but at a beginner-friendly level (emphasize the design process)


### Educating the Adults

Try educating the faculty (Guidance staff) so that there are positive messages coming from other teachers: flyers for their offices - change the narrative around CS (who are the gatekeepers)

### Conclusion

As described in [the podcast](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/invisible-women), it's not the benefits to residents, or the town's bottom line, that is the point here. The point is that well-intentioned city planners, at some point, people *forgot to remember that women exist*

* CS is about talking to people to identify problems and finding ways to solve them using technology
	* professional imperative to open up the day to day of our classrooms so that they reflect the diversity of roles in the software industry
	* moral imperative to ensure women are part of the tech industry so that the software we rely on day in and day out doesn't forget about half the global population

* Not really about languages or technology used but exposing students to the design thinking / iterative development cycle (see TIJ1O docs).
